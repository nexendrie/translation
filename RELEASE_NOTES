A new version of Translation is out. It requires PHP 8.1 and uses some of its new features. It now supports symfony/yaml 6, instead of 5.

Once again, some getters were deprecated. We want to make getters and setters generally protected and/or internal in next major version (or preferably use property hooks on PHP 8.4).

For complete list of changes since previous version, see CHANGELOG.md.
